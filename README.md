# code-quiz
This project is a homework assignment from the UCF Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment, I am tasked with creating a multiple choice quiz that creates a high score based on the time it takes to complete the quiz. The application will feature dynamically updated CSS and HTML using JavaScript.
